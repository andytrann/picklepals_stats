Picklepals.tools is a pickleball doubles match tracking website created by Andy Tran. 
It's built with Rails 6 and uses PostgreSQL for its database. There were two purposes 
for building this website: learn web development and create a skill-based ranked system 
within my pickleball group.

The main functionalities of this site are the following:
  * Create an account to register yourself as a player
  * Submit and store matches played
  * Rollback incorrectly submitted matches
  * Calculate player skill using the recorded matches and the TrueSkill rating system
  * View match history of players and specific matchups
