# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Create a main sample player.
#Player.create!(name: "Andy",
#             email: "AndyTran@example.com",
#             password: "foobar",
#             password_confirmation: "foobar",
#             admin: true)
#
#Player.create!(name: "Steve",
#             email: "SteveLam@example.com",
#             password: "foobar",
#             password_confirmation: "foobar",
#             admin: true)
#
#Player.create!(name: "Leslie",
#             email: "LeslieAlvarado@example.com",
#             password: "foobar",
#             password_confirmation: "foobar",
#             admin: true)
#
#Player.create!(name: "Crystal",
#             email: "CrystalCheung@example.com",
#             password: "foobar",
#             password_confirmation: "foobar")

# Generate a bunch of additional players.
# 40.times do |n|
#   name = Faker::Name.name
#   email = "player-#{n+1}@example.com"
#   password = "password"
#   Player.create!(name: name,
#                email: email,
#                password: password,
